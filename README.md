# dŵr skating

"dŵr skating" is a collection of thoughts, musings, methodologies, measurements, results and analyses related to the influence of skating force and anti-skating mechanisms during vinyl reproduction.

Most of the work centers around **dŵr**, a turntable of my design and execution.

## Description

Skating force, while being an inevitable component of vinyl reproduction, is often glanced over during turntable setup and maintenance. Not because of its lesser importance, but moreso due to the difficulties in understanding its origin and its involvement in playback over the course of a vinyl record side. Manufacturers, especially tonearm designers, do little to elaborate it, and provide users limited avenues to correct for possible errors.

This research was largely influenced by the desire to understand skating force, and ascertain the level of influnce on its own, as well as over other tonearm parameters, during vinyl playback. It is the hope of this author that the results will help both himself and others to further improve vinyl reproduction.

## Methodology

The research aims to understand the amount of influence skating force has on proper reproduction, as well as the capability of compensation mechanisms.

Methodology includes:

- Visualization of skating force using vector graphics and measurements;
- Recording of fundamental tones and associated harmonics over the various areas of a vinyl record;
- Analysis of THD+N and channel balance;
- Determination of optimal compensation mechanisms; and,
- Subjective listening sessions.

## Materials

In addition to the presented paper, this repository aims to include all the associated raw materials generated and used throughout the research, in order to encourage further research, analyses and methodology updates.

These include:

- Audio recordings across a 12" side with varied skating force compensation (300Hz tones, L+R, WAV 32-bit float);
- Individual plot spectra per individual recording (FFT=65536, L+R, TXT);
- THD+N plots per individual recording (PDF);
- Illustratory diagrams (JPG, GIF); and,
- Spreadsheet methodology and analysis toolkit (XLSX).
